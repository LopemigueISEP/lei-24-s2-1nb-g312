| Step 14 : types requested data (km at last check-up)  		                   | 	...validating inputed data?                                            | RegisterCheckUpUI | Pure Fabrication : validate input format                               |
| Step 18 : get vehicle by registration plate 		                             | 	...fetching data?                                                      | CheckUpController | Controller                                                             |

| Step 20 : requests check-up 		                                             | 	... requesting the creation of check-up?                               | CheckUpController | Controller                                                             |

| 			  		                                                                    | 	... saving the edited vehicle object?                                  | VehicleRepository | IE: This repository stores all the vehicles object.                    | 
| Step 27 : operation success  		                                            | 	... informing operation success?                                       | RegisterCheckUpUI      | IE: is responsible for user interactions.                              | 

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

* Employee
* Vehicle
* CheckUp

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

* RegisterCheckUpUI  
* CheckUpController
